1) Make sure that you have a database named - "englishpremiereleague" in your system if you don't then create one

2) Change the host, user and password in Insert.py and Main.py (insert your MySQL details)

3) Create all the procedures and views and create all the tables at least once (it's fine even if they are empty) or you can run the procedures.sql and views.sql once in MySQL. Run the procedures.sql file first

4) Navigate to the folder where you extracted the file in command prompt using cd
Ex - 
f:
cd F:\College\Semester 4\Database Management System\DBMS Project

5) Run the Insert.py File
python Insert.py
